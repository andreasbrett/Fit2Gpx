# Fit2Gpx
converts files and folders containing GPS data in .fit format to .gpx

## Requirements
get the latest version of GPSbabel: http://www.gpsbabel.org

## How to use
Drag and drop file(s), folder(s) and/or both onto the CMDlet. The script will pass all the .fit files to GPSbabel and convert them to .gpx. The file will be named exactly as the .fit file (the extension will change of course).
